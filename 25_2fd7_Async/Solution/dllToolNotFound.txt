Error: dlltool ‘dlltool.exe’ not found
1. I deleted my MSYS2 installation in the directory C:\msys64 (The directory name isn't msys2 - I didn't know that before...) (Of course, you need to know what you had installed before if you do this and want to use it later on)
2. I reinstalled MSYS2 using the installer (select "Open MSYS2 (shell)" to proceed faster)
3. I installed the MinGW toolchain with the command pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
4. I added the ~\msys64\mingw64\bin directory to the PATH
5. It should work! (test it by running cargo check while in the directory of a project with at least one dependency (You don't need to use it in your code))
